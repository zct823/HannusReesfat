custom-alert-view-iOS7
======================

Demonstrates how to create a small presented view that hovers in front of the interface like a UIAlertView.

Originally created in association with this tutorial article: <http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/transcending-uialertview-on-ios-7.html>

In iOS 8, the architecture for customizing presented view controllers changed very greatly from iOS 7, and the project was reorganized accordingly. For the earlier iOS 7 version, checkout commit 7410850.

Now updated to Swift 3 and 4.
